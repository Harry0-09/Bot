My own discord music bot.

2) opusc_nas - leaves a voice chat
3) play [NAME OF THE SONG] - plays a singe song
4) skip - skips a song in a playlist
5) stop - stops playing current song and waits for the counter command
6) wznow - makes song play again
7) stworz playliste [NAZWA] - creates a playlist
8) dodaj_do_playlisty [NAZWA] [LINK YT/PROMPT] - adds a song to a playlist 
9) usun_playliste [NAZWA] - removes a local playlist (no auth working on that)
10) play_playlist [NAZWA] - plays a playlist
11) kolejka [NAZWA PLAYLISTY] - shows the queue of the playlist (rn commas separate the prompts/links)
